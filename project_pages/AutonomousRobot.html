                    <p class="span2">This project was created as part of the systems engineering course Controls for Autonomous Vehicles. 
                    The goal was to create a robot that could autonomously navigate a path using computer vision, IR sensors, and IMUs.</p>
                    <p class="span2">A car platform was provided with all necessary hardware including a Romi 32U4 control board, IR sensors, 
                    camera, and an LED display, but no software libraries were provided. Overall, I gained experience with control 
                    theory (Simulink, PID's, filtering, pure pursuit, dead reckoning, etc.) while also building on my software skills 
                    (Arduino, MATLAB). </p>

                <h2 class="subsection span3">Wall Following</h2>
                <p class="span3">The first challenge tackled in this course was getting the robot to follow a wall at a constant distant. PID control was 
                    used to achieve zero steady state error while the IR sensors were used to measure wall distance. </p>

                <p class="span3">I built a complete, closed loop Simulink model to simulate the robot's motion. I experimented with different types of feedback and 
                    the resulting plots are shown below.</p>

                <h2 class="subsection span3">Pure Pursuit and Bezier Curves</h2>
                <div class="span2">
                    <p>Next,  pure pursuit with Bezier curves was considered. Bezier curves have two major benefits for robotic path planning. First, they have few turning points and are 
                        therefore more smooth. Second, the tangent vectors of the curve at the first and last control point are directed along the Bezier polygon. This allows easy control 
                        of the robots final location and orientation.
                    </p>
                    <p>To the right is a Matlab script that allows the user to select n number of waypoints (which act as the first and last control point) for the robot to travel to. 
                        Once the waypoints have been chosen, two control points are calculated between the waypoints (green dots). Then, Bezier curves are drawn for each set of four 
                        control points (red line). Finally, the path of the path of the robot is calculated using a Simulink model and overlaid (blue line).
